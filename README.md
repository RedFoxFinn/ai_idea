# Idea for an AI application

A rough outline of a AI application idea I came up during *Elements of AI: Building AI* -course

## Idea

*Name your project and prepare to describe it briefly.*

Quick name I came up is **MovingHelper**

The idea is to give the AI application couple of cities, towns or rural areas where you are considering to move to.

Next you would input absolutely required features for the location, house and services.

On the next phase you would input nice-to-have features (for the location, house and services).

After this, the application would be ready to take in the information of houses/apartments you are considering to buy or rent.

## Background
*What is the problem your idea will solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?*

## Data and AI techniques
*What data sources does your project depend on? Almost all AI solutions depend on some data. The availability and quality of the data are essential. Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful? Depending on whether you've been doing the programming exercises or not, you may choose to include a concrete demo implemented by coding, using some actual data!*

## How is it used
*What is the context in which your solution is used, and by whom? Who are the people affected by it? It’s important to appreciate the viewpoints of all those affected.*

## Challenges
*What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations.*

## What next
*How could your project grow and become something even more?*

## Acknowledgments
*If you’re using open source code or documents in your project, make sure you give credit to the creators. Mention your sources of inspiration, too.*
